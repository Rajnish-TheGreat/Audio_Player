# Audio Player Using Flutter
Hello everyone!!! I am back with something new
I made a music player using flutter. Itâ€™s my first app, so, the app is not very advanced.

  ## dependencies used:
  cupertino_icons
  audioplayers
  file_picker
  
  This music player uses File picker package to pick songs from local storage and plays them using Audioplayers package.
